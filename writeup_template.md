**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report

### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

Five steps to detecting the lane lines. 1) For ease convert the image to grayscale. 2) To reduce noise in our image apply a Gaussian smoothing. 3) To identify the edge use the Canny edge detection algorithm. 4) To focus on the lanes only, mask only the region with the lanes. 5) To connect the edges detected as lines run the Hough transform.
